# Redot Engine authors

Redot is a Fork of the Godot Engine that is developed by a community of
voluntary contributors who contribute code, bug reports, documentation,
translations, support, etc., across multiple repositories.

It is impossible to list them all; nevertheless, this file aims at listing
the developers who contributed significant improvements to the engine code.

To keep the list curated, we use a threshold of a minimum of 11 commits.

This file does not strictly reflect copyright ownership for the engine
source code. For this, refer to the Git history to know which contributor
wrote which part of the codebase.

GitHub usernames are indicated in parentheses, or as sole entry when no other
name is available.
