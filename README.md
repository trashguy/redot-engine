## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**[Redot Engine](https://redotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of common tools, so that
users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can
be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop
platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as
Web-based platforms and consoles.

## Free, open source and community-driven

Redot is a completely free and open source fork of Godot under the very permissive MIT license.
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Redot's development is fully independent and truly
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations.

Before being open sourced in [February 2014](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac),
Godot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and
[Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining Godot)
for several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire
titles.

Redot was forked from Godot in [September 2024](https://github.com/Redot-Engine/redot-engine/commit/a12e9de5dd831e1ce0c839f0420b278ef0a6aa5b),
intending to improve upon Godot in order to fulfill its potential and contribute to the shared
codebase of both through a more genuinely community-driven model than Godot.
